# Optimising_hyperparameters_using_Grid_Search

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented the grid search method to optimise the hyperparameter of the model to avoid overfitting. Grid Search is a technique which tend to find the right set of hyperparameter for a particular model.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Optimizing_models_using_Grid_Search/blob/master/data.csv)  
The first 2 columns are x and y coordinates with last column as the labels.

## Installation
* pandas
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* numpy
<code>conda install numpy</code>
* matplotlib
<code>conda install matplotlib</code>
* scikit-learn
<code>conda install scikit-learn</code>

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
